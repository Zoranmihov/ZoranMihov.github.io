                  Task Organizer, a web application build with the intent of
                  helping to break up complex projects in small chunks. Using
                  the Kanban method, users can easily create and organize goals
                  for a fast and smooth problem solving experience. Built with
                  Angular on the front-end and served with Laravel for the
                  backend. Implementing  a Pusher web socket for instantaneous
                  group chat and updates on the tasks.

                  This project uses email verification. If you want to test the
                  email verification portion you would need an inbox,
                  https://temp-mail.org/en/ is an excellent service for that, or
                  if you would like to use an already pre-made account. Email is

                  A MERN stack E-Commerce website meant for small businesses.
                  Having an internet presence can lead to a boost in sales, and
                  every business no matter it's size should have one. That's why
                  I've built this amazon like e-commerce website which allows
                  buyers to leave feedback and ratings on the sold products, a
                  sandbox payment system with Stripe and an admin profile, so
                  the owner can edit, delete or create new products which are
                  sold.
                </p>

                  This project dosen't use email authentication so you can enter
                  a fake email in the registration form, or if you would preffer
                  to see the the site from the owner's perspective you can use
                  this account email admin@gmail.com password FakePassword

                <p>
                  The idea behind FakeVault is a file storage/sharing platform
                  inspired by google drive with the option of alloriwng other

                <p>
                  The idea behind FakeSubscriptions is to build a MERN stack
                  subscription based website that rewards its users based on if
                  they are currently an active donor, and by the total amount of
                  money donated. The purpose of building this was to teach
                  myself about proper authentication and security combined with
                  implementing two of the internet's most famous online payments
                  systems Paypal and Stripe.
